REquired : I am providing you with a detailed CV, and I want you to review it and create a highly professional, eye‑catching portfolio based on it. The portfolio should:

Use my picture from the folder named mypic and display it prominently on the portfolio.

Include light AI‑based subtle animations (not heavy or distracting) to make the portfolio feel modern and interactive.

For every project link deployed on Vercel in the CV, you must explore the live link, gather visual assets (such as screenshots or short video previews). If possible, extract related images or relevant visuals from my LinkedIn to make those sections more impressive and visually engaging in the portfolio.

The portfolio must reflect a professional UI design inspired by this reference:
https://dribbble.com/shots/23081379-Sehlvet-Ecommerce-Woman-s-Clothing-Website

It should have a professional color theme, spacing, typography, visual hierarchy, and interactive elements similar to the inspiration link.

The overall portfolio must be complete, visually appealing, and well‑structured, showing my skills, projects, live links, and animations in a way that attracts attention from employers and recruiters.
